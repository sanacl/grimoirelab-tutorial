# GrimoireLab Tutorial

[GrimoireLab](http://grimoirelab.github.io/) is free, open source software for software development analytics. It allows you to retrieve data from many kinds of data sources with information related to software development, and produce analysis and visualizations with it.

GrimoireLab supports more than 20 different kinds of [data sources](getting-started/data-sources.md), from Github or Gitlab repositories to issue trackers such as Jira or Bugzilla, including messaging systems such as IRC, Slack or mailing lists. With the tools in the GrimoireLab toolset you can retrieve data from those data sources, store it in databases, analyze it, and produce nice dashboards for interactively visualizing the resulting information.
